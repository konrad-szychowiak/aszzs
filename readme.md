<b>720p webcam accurancy:</b> +- 60%, the smaller the code the worse <br />
<b>Iphone 8 cam accurancy:</b> +- 98%, struggles with reading with very small barcodes and the ones that are not on solid base (still reads them mostly accurately, but takes more time to read)<br/><br/>
<b>Conclusion: better webcam/phone cam is needed for the app to run correctly</b>
